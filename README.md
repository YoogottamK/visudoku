# ViSudoku

This is a visual sudoku solver. It takes a picture of a sudoku puzzle as input and then solves and prints the solution.

The whole opencv workflow is explained in `visudoku.ipynb`.
Training data (570 images) was generated by hand. Then, it was augmented in the following ways:
 - added black border of {1..4}px around the image to simulate smaller digits
 - removed black border of {1..4}px from the image to simulate larger digits
 - rotated {4, 8, 12, 16} degrees clockwise and anticlockwise to simulate weird orientations

Digit recognition is done using K-Nearest Neighbours (knn).

The final puzzle is solved by a cpp program (here as a submodule) which I wrote a few years ago.
